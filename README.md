Bunch of schematic symbols (usually for cheap weird parts). Most of the symbols can be
associated to footprints found in the kicad installation or one of the `.pretty` repositories
alongside (with the same basename).

## List of parts

### akn_misc.lib:

* DIODE_BRIDGE : Made it since the default kicad one was *huge*.

### akn_transformers.lib

* TRANSFO-AUDIO : Small no-name audio transformer.

### akn_weird_ics.lib

* HT9032D : 8 pin Belcore FSK caller id decoder
